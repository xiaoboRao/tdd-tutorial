# Todo List App

This is a simple Todo List app built with React and Redux, with Jest and Testing Library for testing. The app allows you to add, remove, and toggle todo items, as well as fetch todo items from an API.

## Installation

To install the app, clone the repository and run:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the app, run:

```
npm run start
```

This will start the app in development mode and open it in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing

To run the tests, run:

```
npm run test
```

This will run the Jest test suite and you can also generate a coverage report using blow command.
```
npm run test --coverage
```


## Code Structure

The app consists of the following components:

- `App`: The main component that renders the list of todo items and provides the ability to add, remove, and toggle items.
- `Todo`: A component that renders a single todo item and provides the ability to toggle and remove it.
- `TodoForm`: A component that renders a form for adding new todo items.

The app also includes a Redux store with a `todo` slice that manages the state of the todo items.

## Testing Overview

The app includes a comprehensive set of Jest tests that cover its basic functionality and interactions with the Redux store and external APIs. The tests use the `@testing-library/react` and `@testing-library/user-event` packages to interact with the rendered components and assert on their behavior.

The test suite includes the following test cases:

### App component:

- `should render todo list`: Checks that the `App` component initially renders a list of three todo items.
- `should add todo`: Checks that a new todo item can be added to the list.
- `should remove todo`: Checks that a todo item can be removed from the list.
- `should toggle todo`: Checks that a todo item can be toggled between completed and not completed states.
- `should get todos from redux directly`: Checks that the `App` component can fetch todo items from an API and render them directly.

### Todo component:

- `should render new item`: Checks that the `Todo` component renders a new, uncompleted todo item with the correct text.
- `should render completed item`: Checks that the `Todo` component renders a completed todo item with the correct text and a "Complete" button.
- `should render redo item`: Checks that the `Todo` component renders an uncompleted todo item with the correct text and a "Redo" button.
- `should toggle item`: Checks that the `Todo` component correctly dispatches a toggle action when the user clicks the "Redo" button.
- `should toggle item when todo not completed`: Checks that the `Todo` component correctly dispatches a toggle action when the user clicks the "Complete" button on an uncompleted todo item.
- `should remove item`: Checks that the `Todo` component correctly dispatches a delete action when the user clicks the "x" button to remove the todo item.

### TodoForm component:

- `TodoForm enter empty input`: Checks that the `TodoForm` component does not dispatch an action when the user hits the `Enter` key with an empty input field.
- `TodoForm add todo when input is not empty`: Checks that the `TodoForm` component correctly dispatches an action when the user hits the `Enter` key with a non-empty input field.

## Acknowledgements

This app was built as a sample project for demonstrating React and Redux features and testing with Jest and Testing Library. The code for this app was based on various online tutorials and examples. and this readme file is generated by ChatGPT, and have a little bit modification by me.
